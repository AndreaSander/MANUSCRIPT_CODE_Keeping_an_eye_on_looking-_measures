#Within a pair of pictures A and B, the fixation to picture A relative to B when A was the target, minus the fixation #to A when A was the distractor.

Calculated the difference in fixation proportions for each item-pair: the proportion of time that infants looked at one video when it was the target, minus the proportion of time they looked at it when it was the distracter.
